# PAC3-Mach-5-for-Gmod
Here is my two Mach 5 PAC3s I made for Gmod. They need SProps and simfphys to function. You needs some PAC3 knowledge to set up. To set this up, you just need to paste the outfits in pac3 folder in Garry's Mod's data folder. To get there, you go into the dupes part of the game's pause menu, click open dupes folder. Once in the dupes folder, go back a directory to the folder labeled garrys mod. When in there, click on the data folder and there should be a folder just called pac3, not pac3_cache.In order to see the car, you need to change the mach 5 bodygroup parent name to the comedy effect of the dukes from the base section of simfphys. This applys to both versions, the "old" one being my old one (duh), and the plain one being more sleek and revamped with custom models I found online from here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4000868     https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:125781 The plain one has a few more bodygroups that need to be setup. The group labled driver_pod should be owned by the pod or seat that the driver sits in (makes sense, right?). The passenger_pod functions the exact same way, but with the passenger seat. Trust me, setup gets faster the more you do it. I should know, since I made it.
The Revamped one has extra bodygroups for the wheels of the dukes, where FL means Front Left and RR means Rear Right. The ones like wheel_FR are supposed to have a parent ending in wheel, while ones like wheel_FR_bone should have a parent with the word "attachment". Other than that, it gets applied like every other outfit.
