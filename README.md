# PAC3-Mach-5-for-Gmod
Here is a simple Mach 5 PAC3 I made for Gmod. It needs SProps and simfphys to function. It needs some PAC3 knowledge to set up, but in order to see the car, you need to change the mach 5 bodygroup parent name to the comedy effect of the duke from the base section of simfphys.
