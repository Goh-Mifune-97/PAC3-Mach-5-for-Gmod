# PAC3-Mach-5-for-Gmod
Here is my two Mach 5 PAC3s I made for Gmod. They need SProps and simfphys to function. You needs some PAC3 knowledge to set up. In order to see the car, you need to change the mach 5 bodygroup parent name to the comedy effect of the duke from the base section of simfphys. This applys to both versions, the duke one being my old one, and the public one being more sleek, and revamped with custom models I found online. from here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4000868     https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:125781
